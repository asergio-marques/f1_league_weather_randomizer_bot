"""season_end_service — automatic season completion and data cleanup.

Two entry points:

check_and_schedule_season_end(server_id, bot)
    Called after every Phase 3 completion.  Checks whether all non-Mystery
    rounds in the active season are done; if so, schedules execute_season_end
    to fire 7 days after the latest round's scheduled_at.

execute_season_end(server_id, season_id, bot)
    Posts a season-completion message to the log channel, then deletes all
    season data (preserving server_configs so the bot stays configured).
    Idempotent: a no-op if no active season is found (handles duplicate calls).
