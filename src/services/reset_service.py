"""reset_service — purge all (or all + config) data for a Discord server.

Caller is responsible for validating the ``confirm`` string before invoking
``reset_server_data``.  This module handles:

1. Collecting intermediate FK-chain IDs (seasons → divisions → rounds).
2. Cancelling any live APScheduler jobs for those rounds.
3. Executing all DELETEs in FK-safe order inside a single transaction.
4. Returning row-count summaries for the caller to display.
